## Album Crud App
<img src="https://github.com/trebloc/rails-drills-to-CRUD/blob/master/crud_app3/app/assets/images/screenshot.png?raw=true">

My app is a user-submitted list of albums showing the artwork, the artist, and the album name. Also, it is a 1-to-Many relationship as Albums has many comments. A user can use all the CRUD to add, get a list, edit, or delete an album.
